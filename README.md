* #### If the program returns any doctors, the program provides the doctor's: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and if the doctor is accepting new patients.
  - Example Input: "sore throat"
  - Example Output: ""

* #### If the API call results in an error, the program should return a notification that states what the error is.
  - Example Input: ""
  - Example Output: "

* #### If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)
  - Example Input: "Park"
